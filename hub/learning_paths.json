Oral oncolytics shift:**\n- More cancer drugs are pills instead of IV infusions\n- Shifts revenue from medical benefit (buy-and-bill at practice) to pharmacy benefit (PBM/specialty pharmacy)\n- Practices lose drug margin revenue\n- Creates new workflows: specialty pharmacy coordination, oral adherence monitoring\n\n**3.

          "title": "RISA's Position in the Ecosystem",
          "content": "Now that you understand the market, let's place RISA precisely on the map.\n\n**What RISA does:**\nAI-powered Revenue Cycle Management specifically for oncology. This means automating the most painful, error-prone, and costly administrative workflows in cancer care.\n\n**Where RISA sits in the value chain:**\n- Between the clinical workflow (EHR) and the financial workflow (payers)\n- Takes clinical data (treatment plans, orders, documentation)\n- Translates it into financial actions (prior auth, claims, coding, appeals)\n- The 'translation layer' between clinical intent and payer requirements\n\n**RISA's addressable market:**\n- ~2,000 cancer centers/programs in the U.S.\n- ~3,000 oncology practices (including small groups)\n- RCM spend per center: $500K-$5M+ annually (staff, outsourced billing, technology)\n- If RISA can capture 5-10% of RCM spend through automation savings, the opportunity per customer is $50K-$500K/year\n\n**The wedge strategy:**\n1. **Start with prior auth automation** - highest pain, clearest ROI, fastest time to value\n2. **Expand to denial management** - natural next step, leverages same data\n3. **Add charge capture and coding** - deeper into the revenue cycle\n4. **Layer in analytics and VBC support** - strategic value, not just operational",
          "hub_connection": "Our entire hub is built to support this strategy. Cancer Centers data = target list. People directory = contacts at each target. Workflows = understanding of what you're automating. Market Map = competitive and partner landscape. The hub isn't just intelligence - it's a sales enablement platform.",
          "key_insight": "RISA's strongest positioning is: 'We don't just do RCM. We do ONCOLOGY RCM.' This specificity is the moat. A general RCM tool can't understand that a Keytruda + Lenvima combination for endometrial cancer has different auth requirements than Keytruda monotherapy for melanoma. RISA can. That domain depth is the entire value proposition.",
          "quiz": [

              "question": "Why should RISA lead with prior authorization automation as its wedge?",
              "options": ["It's the easiest to build", "It's the highest-pain, clearest-ROI workflow with the fastest time to value for the customer", "Prior auth is the only RCM function in oncology", "Competitors haven't thought of it"],
              "correct": 1,
              "explanation": "Prior auth is the #1 pain point cited by oncology practices. It has clear, measurable ROI (time saved per auth x auth volume), quick time to value (results visible in weeks), and creates a foundation for expanding into denial management, coding, and broader RCM automation."

          "title": "Connecting the Dots - A Case Study",
          "content": "Let's put everything together with a real scenario using our hub data.\n\n**Scenario: RISA is targeting Stanford Health Care's cancer program.**\n\n**What we know from our hub:**\n- Stanford Cancer Institute - NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center\n- Academic Medical Center, EHR: Epic (Beacon)\n- Part of Stanford Health Care system\n- 340B eligible (significant drug margin revenue)\n- 45 stakeholders mapped across 4 tiers\n\n**The key people (from our deep dive):**\n- Jill Buathier, Chief Revenue Cycle Officer - PRIMARY buyer, owns auth teams\n- Michael Pfeffer, CIO - must approve Epic integration and security\n- Linda Hoff, CFO - must approve budget\n- Timothy Seay-Morrison, SVP Cancer Services - oncology service line leader\n- Rondeep Brar, Associate Director Clinical Care - operational champion potential\n\n**The approach:**\n1. Lead with Jill Buathier - she feels the prior auth pain daily\n2. Quantify: 'Your auth team handles X auths/month at 45 min each. RISA reduces that to 10 min. That's Y FTE hours saved.'\n3. Get Jill to champion internally - she brings in Michael Pfeffer for technical review\n4. RISA passes Epic integration and HITRUST review with Michael's team\n5. Linda Hoff approves budget based on ROI model Jill presents\n6. Pilot in one department (e.g., medical oncology)\n7. Prove results, expand to radiation oncology and surgical oncology\n\n**The timeline:** 8-14 months from first conversation to full deployment (typical for AMC)\n\n**The revenue:** Stanford is a top-5 U.S. cancer program. The deal value could be $500K-$2M annually.\n\nThis is exactly why the hub exists - to give you this level of preparation before the first conversation.",
          "hub_connection": "Everything in this case study comes directly from our hub: center data, people directory, workflow intelligence, EHR information, and 340B status. This is the model for every target center. The more centers we deep-dive (like we did with Stanford), the more prepared we are.",
          "key_insight": "Intelligence wins deals. Walking into Stanford knowing Jill Buathier's title, her team structure, their EHR, their 340B status, and their workflow pain points is the difference between a cold pitch and a warm, informed conversation. The hub transforms every sales call from 'let me tell you about RISA' to 'we understand your challenges, here's how we solve them.'",
          "quiz": [
            {
              "question": "In the Stanford scenario, why is Jill Buathier the first person to approach, not the CEO or CIO?",
              "options": ["She's the most senior person", "She owns the revenue cycle teams that feel the daily pain of manual prior auth and denials - she's the most motivated buyer", "The CEO and CIO don't care about RCM", "She controls the entire hospital budget"],
              "correct": 1,
              "explanation": "Jill Buathier lives the prior auth problem every day. Her teams are overwhelmed, her denial rates affect her KPIs, and she has budget authority for RCM tools. She's the natural internal champion. The CEO is too high-level for an initial RCM tool conversation, and the CIO needs to be brought in for technical review but isn't the business buyer."
