## A. PATIENT ACCESS & FRONT OFFICE (WF001–WF055)

WF001 | New Patient Referral Intake (Fax) | Patient Access | 1 | Incoming faxed referrals are received, sorted, and entered into the EHR/referral management system. Staff manually read fax pages, extract demographics, diagnosis, and referring physician info. | TX/ST/FH | High fax volume (TX gets thousands/week across 250+ sites), illegible faxes, manual data entry, referrals lost or delayed, no standardized format across referring offices. | **Patient Access AI** — OCR + NLP to auto-parse faxed referrals, extract structured data, flag urgency, and auto-populate EHR fields. Reduce intake time from 15-20 min to <2 min per referral.

WF002 | New Patient Referral Intake (Electronic/eReferral) | Patient Access | 1 | Electronic referrals via Epic CareLink, e-fax portals, or health information exchanges. Staff review and triage. | TX/ST/FH | Incomplete data fields, multiple intake portals to monitor, still requires manual review for clinical appropriateness and routing.

WF003 | Referral Triage & Clinical Review | Patient Access | 1 | Nurse or APP reviews referral for clinical appropriateness, urgency (emergent vs routine), and determines which physician/service line should see the patient. | TX/ST/FH | Bottleneck at triage nurse; inconsistent urgency classification; delays for complex cases needing MD input; ST/FH see high volume of complex/refractory cases needing senior review. | **Clinical AI** — AI-assisted triage scoring based on diagnosis, staging info, prior treatments; auto-suggest subspecialty routing; flag emergent cases (cord compression, SVC syndrome, tumor lysis risk).

WF004 | Insurance Eligibility Verification (Real-Time) | Patient Access | 1 | Staff verify active insurance coverage via payer portals or clearinghouse (Availity, Experian) before scheduling. Check primary, secondary, tertiary coverage. | TX/ST/FH | Multiple payer portals, manual lookups for non-electronic payers, frequent eligibility changes (especially Medicaid), high volume at TX (250+ sites). Incorrect eligibility leads to claim denials. | **Patient Access AI** — Automated batch eligibility checks on all scheduled patients nightly + real-time verification at intake; auto-flag coverage gaps; predict eligibility issues based on historical patterns.

WF005 | Benefits Investigation | Patient Access | 1 | Deep-dive into patient's specific plan benefits: oncology carve-outs, specialty pharmacy requirements, out-of-pocket maximums, accumulator/maximizer programs, site-of-care restrictions. | TX/ST/FH | Extremely time-consuming (20-45 min per patient for complex regimens), payer websites inconsistent, phone hold times, benefits change mid-treatment, specialty pharmacy vs medical benefit confusion. | **Patient Access AI** — AI agent that auto-navigates payer portals, extracts benefit details, maps to planned treatment regimen, calculates estimated patient responsibility.

## Top 20 Highest-Impact AI Opportunities for RISA Labs

| Rank | Workflow(s) | AI Product | Impact Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | WF006, WF007, WF008, WF010, WF011, WF012 | **Prior Authorization AI** (Patient Access AI) | #1 pain point universally. Billions in delayed/denied care annually. High volume at TX (thousands/week). Automating clinical data compilation, submission, tracking, and appeals could save 15-20 FTEs per large organization. |
| **2** | WF152, WF153, WF154 | **Denial Management AI** (RCM AI) | 10-20% denial rates in oncology. Auto-categorize, auto-resolve correctable denials, auto-generate appeals with clinical justification. Revenue recovery of millions annually per organization. |
| **3** | WF110 | **Ambient Clinical Documentation AI** (Clinical AI) | Provider burnout driver #1. AI scribe for oncology visits could reclaim 2+ hours/day per provider. 550+ providers at TX alone = massive impact. Oncology-specific note generation is differentiated. |
| **4** | WF001, WF002, WF003, WF037 | **Referral Intake & Triage AI** (Patient Access AI) | Fax-based referral intake is universal bottleneck. OCR + NLP to auto-parse, structure, triage, and route referrals. Reduces intake time from 15-20 min to <2 min. Thousands of referrals daily at TX scale. |
| **5** | WF180, WF179, WF050 | **Clinical Trial Matching AI** (Clinical AI / Life Sciences AI) | Most eligible patients never offered trials. Real-time matching against 200-500 open trials at academic centers. Massive unmet need for pharma sponsors (enrollment is #1 cost driver). Dual revenue: provider tool + pharma data. |
| **6** | WF058, WF071 | **Chemo Order Verification & Lab Review AI** (Clinical AI) | Safety-critical: dosing errors in chemo are life-threatening. AI pre-verification could catch errors faster, reduce pharmacy bottleneck, auto-flag "ok to treat" from labs. |
| **7** | WF145, WF146, WF166 | **Drug Billing & Reimbursement AI** (RCM AI) | Drug revenue is 50-70% of oncology practice revenue. NDC-HCPCS mapping, waste documentation, ASP monitoring, margin analysis. Even 1-2% improvement = millions. |
| **8** | WF059, WF015 | **Infusion Chair Optimization AI** (Clinical AI) | Chair utilization directly = revenue. Moving from 65% to 85% utilization across 200+ infusion suites (TX) is transformative. Dynamic scheduling with real-time adjustments. |
| **9** | WF005, WF019, WF020 | **Benefits Investigation & Financial Counseling AI** (Patient Access AI) | 20-45 min per patient for benefits investigation. Auto-navigate payer portals, extract benefits, calculate costs, match to assistance programs. Reduces financial toxicity and surprise bills. |
| **10** | WF076, WF077 | **Tumor Board AI** (Clinical AI) | Auto-generate case presentations, compile all relevant data, AI scribe for documentation, track recommendation implementation. Saves 30-60 min prep time per case. |
| **11** | WF143, WF144, WF164 | **AI-Powered Medical Coding** (RCM AI) | Coder shortage is severe. AI coding from clinical documentation with oncology-specific logic. 100% coding audit (not sample-based). Accuracy + speed + compliance. |
| **12** | WF063 | **Radiation Therapy Auto-Contouring & Planning AI** (Clinical AI) | Contouring takes hours per patient. AI auto-contouring reduces to minutes with physician review. Auto-plan generation for standard cases. Already gaining traction but huge market. |
| **13** | WF184, WF185 | **EHR-to-EDC Data Bridge** (Life Sciences AI) | Manual dual data entry is #1 bottleneck in trial operations. Auto-populate CRFs from EHR data. Saves coordinator time, improves data quality, accelerates trials. |
| **14** | WF056, WF083, WF038 | **Patient Triage & Call Center AI** (Patient Access AI / Clinical AI) | AI voice agent for routine calls, AI-assisted nurse triage with protocol-based recommendations, 24/7 availability. Reduces call volume, improves after-hours care, prevents unnecessary ED visits. |
| **15** | WF034, WF035 | **No-Show Prediction & Prevention AI** (Patient Access AI) | ML prediction of no-shows 24-48 hrs ahead, targeted intervention based on predicted barrier, automated backfill from waitlist. 5-15% no-show rate recovery is significant revenue and access improvement. |
| **16** | WF089, WF086 | **Survivorship & Care Transition AI** (Clinical AI) | Auto-generate personalized survivorship care plans, surveillance schedules, PCP communication. Huge gap in current practice. CoC requirement. |
| **17** | WF087, WF088 | **Palliative Care / Prognosis AI** (Clinical AI) | Predict patients who would benefit from palliative care, support goals-of-care conversations, improve hospice referral timing. High clinical and humanitarian impact. |
| **18** | WF231 | **Cancer Registry Abstraction AI** (Clinical AI) | Labor-intensive, registrar shortage. AI auto-abstraction from EHR could save hundreds of hours per year per institution. |
| **19** | WF172, WF216 | **Value-Based Care Analytics AI** (RCM AI) | EOM/MIPS compliance automation, episode cost prediction, quality measure auto-capture. Critical as oncology moves to value-based payment. |
| **20** | WF125, WF131, WF099 | **Immune Toxicity Monitoring AI** (Clinical AI) | GVHD in BMT and irAEs in immunotherapy are major challenges. AI early detection from labs/symptoms, auto-suggest management per guidelines. Growing market as immunotherapy and cell therapy expand. |
