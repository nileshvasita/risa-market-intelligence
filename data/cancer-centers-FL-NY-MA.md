## New York Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total centers listed** | 55 |
| **NCI-Designated** | 7 (most of any state - 5 Comprehensive, 1 Cancer Center, 1 Basic) |
| **Population served** | ~19.5 million |

**Dominant Health Systems/Practices in Oncology:**
- **Memorial Sloan Kettering** - Global oncology brand, 800+ oncologists, expanding satellite network (Nassau, Westchester, NJ). Largest cancer center in the US by revenue

**Key Market Dynamics:**
- **Most NCI centers of any state**: 7 NCI-designated centers create intense academic competition but also massive clinical trial infrastructure
- **MSK network effect**: MSK's satellite expansion (Nassau, Westchester, NJ) is disrupting community oncology referral patterns
- **Payer complexity**: Heavy managed care (Empire, Aetna, United, Medicaid Managed Care); prior auth burden is among highest nationally
- **NYC density**: Extreme provider density in Manhattan creates competition but also access challenges in outer boroughs and upstate
- **Upstate-downstate divide**: Western NY (Buffalo/Roswell Park), Central NY (Syracuse), and Capital Region (Albany) are functionally separate markets from NYC metro
- **Safety-net oncology**: NYC Health + Hospitals serves large uninsured/Medicaid population; Montefiore and Brooklyn systems serve diverse, underserved communities
- **New York Proton Center**: Multi-institutional proton center (MSK, Montefiore, Mount Sinai) opened 2019 in Manhattan
- **Workforce**: High cost of living and burnout driving oncologist recruitment challenges, especially upstate

## Massachusetts Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total centers listed** | 42 |
| **NCI-Designated** | 2 (Dana-Farber and Mass General - both Comprehensive) |
| **Population served** | ~7 million |

**Dominant Health Systems/Practices in Oncology:**
- **Mass General Brigham (formerly Partners)** - Dominant system; includes Mass General Cancer Center (NCI) and Brigham and Women's, 500+ combined oncologists
- **Dana-Farber Cancer Institute** - Global brand, 400+ oncologists; extensive satellite network across MA and New England. Joint operation with Brigham and Women's

- **Tufts Medicine** - Growing system (Tufts Medical Center, Lowell General, MetroWest) with cancer programs
- **UMass Memorial** - Central MA anchor; academic center in Worcester
- **Baystate Health** - Western MA's largest system based in Springfield

**Key Market Dynamics:**
- **Dana-Farber/MGB dominance**: The Dana-Farber/Mass General Brigham ecosystem controls the majority of academic oncology in New England; referral patterns extend across 6 states
- **Highest per-capita oncologist density**: MA has more oncologists per capita than any other state; competition for patients is intense
- **Research powerhouse**: Dana-Farber, Mass General, Broad Institute, MIT Koch Institute create an unmatched cancer research ecosystem
- **Payer landscape**: Near-universal insurance coverage (MA health reform); strong commercial payer market but rate pressure from state cost growth benchmarks
- **System consolidation**: Mass General Brigham expansion (satellite sites in Waltham, Westborough, Woburn) extending reach into suburbs
- **Dana-Farber network strategy**: Satellite cancer centers embedded in community hospitals across MA/NH/ME extend the brand while keeping patients in network
- **Community practice survival**: Small independent practices face existential pressure from system expansion; New England Cancer Specialists (OneOncology) is one of few scaled independents
- **Life sciences ecosystem**: Proximity to biotech (Cambridge/Kendall Square) drives clinical trial availability and early drug access
- **Cost concerns**: MA has among the highest healthcare costs nationally; state Health Policy Commission monitors system pricing power
