# State Market Summaries

## California Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total centers listed** | 72 |
| **NCI-Designated** | 8 (most of any state — all Comprehensive) |
| **Population served** | ~39 million |

**Dominant Health Systems in Oncology:**
- **Kaiser Permanente** — Largest integrated oncology network in CA (~500+ oncologists across N/S CA)
- **City of Hope** — Expanding aggressively (acquired Cancer Treatment Centers of America sites, opened Orange County campus)
- **Providence** — Major presence in SoCal and NorCal through St. Joseph and other affiliates

- **Payer mix**: Heavy managed care (Kaiser, Blue Shield, Health Net); Medi-Cal expansion bringing more oncology volume to safety-net systems
- **340B Program**: Critical revenue driver for hospital outpatient oncology; community practices losing competitive ground
- **Site-of-care shift**: Payers pushing infusion to outpatient/home settings — impacting hospital cancer center revenue
- **Precision oncology leadership**: CA leads in biomarker testing adoption and clinical trial enrollment

- **Rapid population growth**: Austin, DFW, Houston suburbs driving new cancer center construction
- **MD Anderson network effect**: Regional satellites + AccessHope partnership extend reach; community practices compete for referrals
- **South TX/border**: Underserved, growing Hispanic population with late-stage presentation patterns
- **Clinical trials powerhouse**: MD Anderson, START SA, Mary Crowley — TX is a top trial enrollment state

**Dominant Health Systems in Oncology:**
- **Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center / UW Medicine** — Dominant academic/NCI center; merged SCCA into Fred Hutch in 2022
- **Providence / Swedish** — Largest system footprint in WA oncology (10+ cancer sites combined)
- **Virginia Mason Franciscan Health (CommonSpirit)** — Major Puget Sound presence
- **MultiCare Health** — Growing in Tacoma, Auburn, Spokane
- **Kaiser Permanente Washington** — Significant managed care oncology
- **PeaceHealth** — Dominant in NW WA and SW WA

**Key Market Dynamics:**
- **Fred Hutch consolidation**: 2022 merger of Fred Hutch + SCCA + UW Cancer creates a regional powerhouse but raises competition concerns
- **Providence's reach**: Extends from Seattle suburbs to rural eastern WA; largest system by geography
- **Community practice shrinkage**: NW Medical Specialties is one of few remaining large independents (aligned with OneOncology)
- **Tech-forward market**: Seattle's tech ecosystem drives health IT adoption; strong AI/digital health appetite among systems
- **Payer landscape**: Managed care dominant (Premera, Regence, Molina); Apple Health (Medicaid) expanding oncology access
- **Rural access challenges**: Eastern WA significantly underserved; Tri-Cities Cancer Center is a critical independent
- **Proton therapy**: SCCA Proton Center (only one in PNW) is a regional draw

# RISA Labs Proof-of-Work Letter

**RISA Labs** | Healthcare AI That Works

---

*Dear [Name], [Title]*
*[Cancer Center / Health System]*

**RE: Transforming Oncology Operations with Purpose-Built AI**

---

We are **RISA Labs**, a healthcare AI company purpose-built for the operational and clinical complexities of cancer care delivery. We partner with oncology practices, cancer centers, and health systems to deploy AI that measurably improves access, revenue, and clinical efficiency — without adding burden to your teams.

### What We've Built

RISA's AI platform spans four domains designed for healthcare:

| Capability | What It Does | Oncology Impact |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Patient Access AI** | Intelligent scheduling, referral triage, prior authorization automation, waitlist optimization | Reduce new patient appointment lag from 14 days → 3 days; increase infusion chair utilization by 15-20% |
| **RCM AI** | Claims optimization, denial prediction & prevention, coding accuracy, 340B compliance automation | Recover 3-5% of net revenue through reduced denials; automate 70%+ of prior auth workflows for specialty drugs |
| **Clinical AI** | Clinical documentation, pathway adherence monitoring, treatment summarization, tumor board prep | Save 45+ minutes per oncologist per day on documentation; improve NCCN pathway adherence by 12% |
| **Life Sciences AI** | Clinical trial matching, real-world evidence extraction, site feasibility analysis | Increase trial enrollment by 30-40%; automate patient-to-protocol matching across your EHR in real time |

### Why Oncology Specifically

Cancer care is the most operationally complex service line in healthcare. Prior authorizations for biologics and immunotherapies take **2-5x longer** than other specialties. Documentation requirements for multi-disciplinary care are crushing physician productivity. And the gap between available clinical trials and enrolled patients represents both a revenue loss and a care quality failure.

**RISA was designed for this complexity.** Our models are trained on oncology-specific workflows — not general-purpose healthcare AI retrofitted for cancer care.

### Projected Outcomes for a Typical Cancer Center (50+ Oncologists)

- **$4-8M annual revenue recovery** through denial prevention and coding optimization
- **2,500+ staff hours saved annually** on prior authorizations alone
- **30% faster** new patient access (scheduling + referral triage)
- **40% increase** in clinical trial screening-to-enrollment conversion
- **Full EHR integration** — Epic, Oracle Health, Flatiron, OncoEMR compatible

### Our Ask

We would welcome **30 minutes** to share a tailored analysis of how RISA's platform could impact your organization. We bring data, not slides — including a custom ROI model based on your center's profile.

If you're attending the **Becker's Oncology Executive Summit** (April 13-14, Chicago), we'd be glad to connect in person. RISA Labs is a proud sponsor of this year's event.
