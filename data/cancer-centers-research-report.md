## D. AI Use-Case Mapping

| RISA Labs Vertical | Opportunity | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Patient Access AI** | 🔴 **HIGH** | 250+ locations = massive scheduling complexity. Prior auth for chemo drugs is a nightmare. Insurance verification across dozens of payers. Referral management from PCPs across Texas. This is THE pain point for community oncology. |
| **RCM AI** | 🔴 **HIGH** | Buy-and-bill model means drug coding and charge capture is extremely complex. Denials on oncology drugs (J-codes, NDC crosswalks) are epidemic. McKesson provides back-office but practices still leak revenue. Claims volume is enormous at 68K+ patients/year. |
| **Clinical AI** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | They use iKnowMed EHR with built-in pathways (Via Oncology/NCCN). Clinical trial matching is relevant (US Oncology Research runs 100+ trials). Less need for tumor board AI (community model). Treatment planning standardization is a fit. |
| **Life Sciences** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | US Oncology Research arm runs Phase I-IV trials. Real-world data from 68K+ patients is valuable to pharma. McKesson already monetizes some of this through Ontada (their data/analytics subsidiary). Opportunity exists but competes with Ontada. |

**Key Insight:** Patient Access and RCM are the slam-dunk entry points. Texas Oncology's scale makes even small per-encounter efficiency gains worth millions.

## D. AI Use-Case Mapping

| RISA Labs Vertical | Opportunity | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Patient Access AI** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Complex referral patterns (patients come nationally/internationally for BMT). Integration complexity between Fred Hutch and UW Medicine systems. Prior auth for transplant and CAR-T is extremely complex and high-value. Fewer total patients than TX Onc but higher complexity per case. |
| **RCM AI** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | BMT and CAR-T billing is among the most complex in all of medicine (6-figure claims, multi-month episodes). Denials on transplant authorizations are devastating. Opportunity is high-value but niche. Post-merger SCCA integration may have created billing complexity. |
| **Clinical AI** | 🔴 **HIGH** | Clinical trials matching is critical — they run extensive trials. Treatment planning for BMT/CAR-T is complex. Genomic interpretation for hematologic malignancies. Tumor board support. Real-time clinical decision support for transplant complications. |
| **Life Sciences** | 🔴 **HIGH** | This is Fred Hutch's DNA. They spun out Juno Therapeutics. Massive biobank. Real-world evidence from decades of BMT data. Pharma partnerships for cell therapy, immunotherapy. Biomarker programs. Clinical trial enrollment optimization. They are a data-rich institution looking to monetize IP. |

**Key Insight:** Fred Hutch is the ideal Life Sciences AI partner. Their research-to-clinic pipeline is extraordinary. Clinical AI for trial matching and complex treatment planning is the clinical entry point. The SCCA merger created operational integration challenges that Patient Access and RCM AI could address.

# F. Pain Points

## Universal Pain Points Across All Three Centers

### 1. Prior Authorization Hell 🔥🔥🔥
- **Severity: Critical** — #1 pain point in oncology
- Average 40+ hours/week per practice spent on prior auth (ASCO surveys)
- Chemo drugs, imaging, genomic tests, and procedures ALL require PA
- Delays cause treatment delays → worse outcomes → liability risk
- Step therapy and fail-first protocols force patients onto cheaper drugs first
- **Texas Oncology impact:** Multiplied by 250+ sites = thousands of PA requests daily
- **Stanford impact:** Novel/experimental therapies have even higher denial rates
- **Fred Hutch impact:** BMT and CAR-T prior auth can take weeks; $500K+ per case

### 2. Denials & Revenue Leakage 🔥🔥🔥
- **Severity: Critical**
- Oncology has among the highest denial rates of any specialty (15-25% initial denial rate)
- Drug denials (wrong J-code, NDC mismatch, medical necessity) are epidemic
- Many practices write off 3-5% of net revenue to preventable denials
- Appeals are manual, time-consuming, and often not pursued
- **Texas Oncology:** At $2B+ revenue, even 1% leakage = $20M+ annually
- **Stanford/Fred Hutch:** Complex cases = higher per-claim value at risk

### 3. Staffing Shortages & Burnout 🔥🔥
- **Severity: High**
- Oncology nursing shortage is acute nationwide
- Prior auth staff, coders, and billers are in short supply
- Physician burnout from documentation burden (pajama time on EHR)
- APP (NP/PA) roles expanding to fill physician gaps
- **Texas Oncology:** Rural Texas locations struggle most with recruitment
- **Academic centers:** Compete for talent with tech companies (especially Stanford in Silicon Valley)

### 4. EHR Frustration 🔥🔥
- **Severity: High**
- Texas Oncology uses iKnowMed (McKesson) — functional but dated, limited interoperability
- Stanford and Fred Hutch use Epic — powerful but complex, click-heavy
- Oncology workflows don't fit neatly into general EHR designs
- Treatment plan documentation is cumbersome
- Clinical trial documentation in EHR is a square-peg-round-hole problem

### 5. Clinical Trial Enrollment Bottlenecks 🔥🔥
- **Severity: High**
- Only 3-5% of adult cancer patients enroll in clinical trials
- Screening for eligibility across hundreds of criteria is manual
- Patients don't know what trials are available
- **Stanford (250+ trials):** Matching patients to the right trial is a needle-in-haystack problem
- **Fred Hutch:** Same challenge, especially for rare diseases
- **Texas Oncology:** Community sites often don't have trial awareness; US Oncology Research runs trials but enrollment lags

### 6. Care Coordination Complexity 🔥🔥
- **Severity: High**
- Cancer care involves 6-12 different specialties per patient
- Records transfer between facilities is still largely fax-based
- Transition from active treatment → survivorship → palliative → hospice is poorly coordinated
- **Texas Oncology:** 250+ sites means internal coordination is challenging
- **Fred Hutch:** Fred Hutch + UW Medicine integration post-merger adds complexity

### 7. Patient Access & Wait Times 🔥
- **Severity: Moderate-High**
- New patient appointments can take 2-4 weeks at academic centers
- Rural Texas patients travel hours for treatment
- Scheduling complexity for multi-modal therapy (surgery + chemo + radiation)
- **Stanford:** Wait times for consults can be weeks due to demand
- **Texas Oncology:** Better access due to distributed model, but scheduling across 250+ sites is complex

### 8. Drug Cost & Access 🔥
- **Severity: Moderate-High**
- Oral oncolytic costs are staggering ($10K-20K/month)
- Specialty pharmacy coordination is a full-time job
- 340B program complexity and compliance burden
- Biosimilar adoption and payer steering create confusion
